# 🧩 Maze Solver Visualizer

A simple maze-solving visualizer using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This project takes a predefined 16x16 maze and finds the shortest path from a **Start (S)** point to a **Goal (G)** point. The path, once found, is marked with `*`.

## 🎮 Features

- 📏 16x16 grid maze with walls (`#`), open spaces (` `), a **Start** point (`S`), and a **Goal** point (`G`)
- 🔍 Uses **BFS algorithm** to find the shortest path
- ✨ Visualizes the solution by tracing the shortest path
- 🧠 Clean UI with easy-to-understand maze structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
